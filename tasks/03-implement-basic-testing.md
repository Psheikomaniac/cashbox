# Implement Basic Testing

## Current Issues

1. **Almost No Tests**
   - Only 6 controller tests despite comprehensive test documentation
   - Found tests:
     - ImportControllerTest.php
     - PaymentControllerTest.php
     - PenaltyControllerTest.php
     - PenaltyTypeControllerTest.php
     - TeamControllerTest.php
     - UserControllerTest.php
   - Missing tests for:
     - Most controllers (10 out of 16 controllers have no tests)
     - Services
     - Repositories
     - Entities
     - DTOs
     - Message handlers

2. **Lack of Test Coverage**
   - Critical business logic is not tested
   - No integration tests for database operations
   - No tests for API Platform resources
   - No tests for validation logic

3. **Inconsistent Test Approach**
   - The existing tests focus only on controllers
   - No unit tests for individual components
   - No test data fixtures

## Recommended Actions

1. **Implement Unit Tests**
   - Create tests for all services
   - Test repositories with database interactions
   - Test entities and their validation constraints
   - Test DTOs and their transformation logic

2. **Expand Controller Tests**
   - Add tests for all remaining controllers
   - Test different response scenarios (success, validation errors, not found, etc.)
   - Test authentication and authorization

3. **Add Integration Tests**
   - Test the interaction between components
   - Test database operations with real or in-memory databases
   - Test API endpoints end-to-end

4. **Create Test Data Fixtures**
   - Develop reusable test data fixtures
   - Use fixtures to set up test environments consistently
   - Create different fixture sets for different test scenarios

5. **Implement Continuous Integration**
   - Set up automated test runs on code changes
   - Enforce minimum test coverage requirements
   - Add static analysis tools to the CI pipeline

## Implementation Priority

This task should be addressed with medium-high priority after fixing the security issues and standardizing the API approach. Having comprehensive tests will help catch regressions when making changes to the codebase and ensure that the application behaves as expected.

Start with the most critical components:
1. Authentication and authorization
2. Payment processing
3. Contribution management
4. Reporting functionality
