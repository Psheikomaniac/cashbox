# Fix Security Immediately

## Current Issues

1. **Authentication is broken**
   - JWT is configured but all API routes allow PUBLIC_ACCESS
   - In the security.yaml file, all API routes are set to PUBLIC_ACCESS, which means no authentication is required
   ```yaml
   access_control:
       - { path: ^/api/login, roles: PUBLIC_ACCESS }
       - { path: ^/api/docs, roles: PUBLIC_ACCESS }
       - { path: ^/api, roles: PUBLIC_ACCESS }
   ```

2. **No real user authentication system**
   - Using in-memory provider with no real user system
   - The security.yaml file shows that the application is using an in-memory user provider:
   ```yaml
   providers:
       # Used for JWT token creation and validation
       # This will be replaced with a proper user provider when the User entity is implemented
       users_in_memory: { memory: null }
   ```

3. **Missing password field on User entity**
   - The User entity does not have a password field
   - The User entity does not implement UserInterface or PasswordAuthenticatedUserInterface
   - Without these, proper authentication cannot be implemented

4. **No rate limiting or CORS configuration**
   - The application lacks rate limiting to prevent brute force attacks
   - No CORS configuration to control which domains can access the API

## Recommended Actions

1. **Update User Entity**
   - Add a password field to the User entity
   - Implement UserInterface and PasswordAuthenticatedUserInterface
   - Add roles field to support role-based access control

2. **Configure Proper Authentication**
   - Replace in-memory provider with a database user provider
   - Update security.yaml to require authentication for API routes
   - Only keep necessary routes as PUBLIC_ACCESS (login, registration)

3. **Implement Rate Limiting**
   - Add rate limiting for login attempts to prevent brute force attacks
   - Configure rate limiting for API endpoints to prevent abuse

4. **Configure CORS**
   - Set up proper CORS configuration to control which domains can access the API
   - Restrict allowed origins, methods, and headers

## Implementation Priority

This task should be addressed with the highest priority as it represents a critical security vulnerability in the application. Without proper authentication, the application's data is exposed to unauthorized access.
