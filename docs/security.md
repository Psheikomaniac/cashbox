# Security Guidelines

This document outlines the security practices and guidelines for the Cashbox project.

## Overview

Security is a top priority for our application, which handles sensitive financial data. This document provides guidelines for implementing secure coding practices, protecting against common vulnerabilities, and ensuring data protection.

## General Security Principles

### Defense in Depth

Implement multiple layers of security controls throughout the application:

- Network security
- Application security
- Data security
- Authentication and authorization
- Input validation
- Output encoding
- Error handling

### Least Privilege

- Apply the principle of least privilege to all components
- Restrict permissions to the minimum required
- Use role-based access control
- Regularly audit permissions

### Secure by Default

- All features should be secure in their default configuration
- Security should not rely on proper configuration
- Disable unnecessary features and services

## Authentication and Authorization

### Authentication

- Use Symfony's security component for authentication
- Implement JWT-based authentication for API endpoints
- Enforce strong password policies
- Support multi-factor authentication
- Implement account lockout after failed attempts
- Use secure credentials storage with password hashing
- Use Argon2id for password hashing with appropriate cost factors

### Authorization

- Implement fine-grained role-based access control
- Use Symfony's Voter system for complex authorization rules
- Apply authorization checks at controller and service levels
- Verify object ownership where appropriate
- Audit authorization decisions

### JWT Security

- Use short-lived JWT tokens (15-30 minutes)
- Implement refresh token rotation
- Sign tokens with strong algorithms (RS256)
- Include only necessary claims in tokens
- Store tokens securely on client-side
- Never store sensitive information in tokens

## Input Validation and Sanitization

### Input Validation

- Validate all input data at API boundaries
- Use Symfony's Validator component for validation
- Implement both syntactic and semantic validation
- Use appropriate constraints for each data type
- Add custom validators for domain-specific validation

### Sanitization

- Sanitize data before storage and display
- Use appropriate encoding for different contexts
- Implement context-specific sanitization strategies
- Never trust client-supplied data

## Protection Against Common Vulnerabilities

### SQL Injection

- Use Doctrine ORM for database interactions
- Use parameterized queries for custom SQL
- Never concatenate user input in queries
- Apply appropriate input validation

### Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

- Apply proper output encoding in all contexts
- Use Twig's automatic escaping
- Use Content Security Policy (CSP) headers
- Validate and sanitize HTML input
- Use HTTPOnly and Secure flags for cookies

### Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)

- Implement CSRF protection for all forms
- Use Symfony's CSRF protection component
- Apply proper token validation
- Use SameSite cookie attribute

### Injection Attacks

- Validate and sanitize all inputs
- Use secure APIs for system interactions
- Apply proper context-based escaping
- Avoid shell executions where possible

### Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR)

- Implement proper authorization checks for all resources
- Use indirect references where appropriate
- Verify ownership before access
- Apply access control checks at multiple levels

## Data Protection

### Data Classification

Classify data based on sensitivity:

- **Public**: Information that can be freely disclosed
- **Internal**: Information for internal use only
- **Confidential**: Sensitive business information
- **Restricted**: Highly sensitive personal or business data

### Data Protection Measures

- Encrypt sensitive data at rest
- Use HTTPS for all communications
- Implement proper access controls
- Apply data minimization principles
- Implement data retention policies

### Database Security

- Use encrypted connections to the database
- Limit database user privileges
- Apply column-level encryption for sensitive data
- Regular database security audits
- Secure database backups

## Session Management

- Use secure session handling with Symfony's session component
- Implement proper session timeout and expiration
- Store session data securely
- Apply secure cookie settings
- Regenerate session IDs after authentication

## Security Headers

Implement the following security headers:

- Content-Security-Policy (CSP)
- X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
- X-Frame-Options: DENY
- X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
- Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS)
- Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin
- Permissions-Policy

## Error Handling and Logging

### Secure Error Handling

- Implement custom error handling
- Never expose sensitive information in error messages
- Use generic error messages in production
- Log detailed errors for debugging

### Logging

- Implement comprehensive security logging
- Log security-relevant events
- Include necessary context in logs
- Protect log integrity
- Implement log rotation and retention
- Centralize log collection and analysis

## Dependency Management

- Regularly update dependencies
- Use Composer to manage dependencies
- Implement a dependency vulnerability scanning process
- Monitor security advisories
- Have a response plan for vulnerable dependencies

## Security Testing

### Static Analysis

- Use security-focused static analysis tools (Psalm with taint analysis)
- Run static analysis in CI/CD pipeline
- Address critical findings promptly

### Dynamic Testing

- Implement security-focused test cases
- Test authentication and authorization flows
- Test input validation and sanitization
- Test for common vulnerabilities

### Penetration Testing

- Conduct regular penetration testing
- Use a combination of automated and manual testing
- Address findings based on risk assessment
- Document testing methodology and results

## Secure Development Practices

### Code Reviews

- Include security-focused review criteria
- Use security-minded reviewers
- Verify security controls during review
- Check for common security mistakes

### Secrets Management

- Never commit secrets to the repository
- Use environment variables for secrets
- Consider using a secrets management service
- Rotate secrets regularly

### Deployment Security

- Use secure deployment processes
- Implement infrastructure as code
- Apply security controls at infrastructure level
- Conduct security validation during deployment

## Security Incident Response

- Develop and maintain an incident response plan
- Designate incident response roles and responsibilities
- Implement detection mechanisms
- Document response procedures
- Conduct post-incident reviews

## Compliance

- Identify applicable regulations and standards
- Implement required controls
- Conduct regular compliance assessments
- Document compliance efforts
