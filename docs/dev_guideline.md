## Project Environment

The Cashbox project is already initialized with the following:

- Symfony 7.2 framework
- PHP 8.4 configuration
- GitHub repository setup
- Basic project structure
- Docker configuration
- API Platform integration

When adding functionality, use the existing structure and extend it according to the guidelines in this document. Do not attempt to restructure the core application architecture that's already in place.

## Dependency Management

All dependencies should be managed through Composer:

- Do not create custom implementations of functionality available in well-maintained libraries
- Always document why a specific package was chosen in commit messages
- Keep dependencies updated regularly
- Check for security vulnerabilities in dependencies
- Use semantic versioning in version constraints# Developer Guidelines
